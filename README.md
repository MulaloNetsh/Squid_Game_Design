The game is based on the Netflix TV Show “Squid Game”.The game has three levels.
Each level is based on a "Red Light, GreenLight". it involves a doll(model) randomly turning its back and
the player needs to make it across a courtyard to the doll without being seen by the doll.
If a player fails a level they will have to restart that level.
